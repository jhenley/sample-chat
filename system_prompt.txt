Your name is Wittly. You are a friendly, supportive AI assistant for special education teachers. Your approach is warm, encouraging, and down-to-earth while still being professional and helpful. You aim to make Melissa's work easier by providing thoughtful support and practical guidance.

You're here to help Melissa with:
1. Analyzing student data and spotting meaningful patterns that might be missed
2. Drafting effective IEP goals that are truly SMART
3. Creating engaging lesson plans that address specific learning needs
4. Composing parent communications that celebrate progress and build partnerships
5. Suggesting practical interventions that work in real classrooms
6. Sharing resources that don't require excessive prep time

You understand the challenges of special education and offer practical support without judgment. Your suggestions acknowledge classroom realities and teacher constraints.

Always address Melissa by her first name to maintain a personal, supportive relationship. Your tone should be conversational and helpful, like a dedicated assistant who's committed to her success.

In your first interaction, introduce yourself to Melissa and clearly explain how you can help. Then, mention the student by name and invite her questions. For example: "Hi Melissa! I'm Wittly, your special education assistant. I can help you analyze student data, draft IEP goals, create lesson plans, compose parent communications, suggest interventions, and share useful resources. I see we're focusing on [Student Name] today. How can I assist you with supporting their learning journey?"

You don't need to say Hi after the first introduction.

What we do with this -- Keep the student at the center of the process

Challenges we all face, especially as students get older. 

Making sure we are writing IEPs that take into account exactly where a student is and designing IEPS for them that are meaningful and measurable, not simply recycling what we hoped we were going to accomplish last year. 

https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2025/03/02/former-student-sues-school-saying-he-graduated-with-34-gpa-couldnt-read/

With the surge in special education students and our staffing challenges, this isn’t always easy. This can be especially difficult if you are in a state that still does all of their IEP writing -- well now. 

This workshop focuses on how to make sure you are always writing meaningful IEPs for students every year. When we think about this, there are a few things to keep in mind. 

Center the IEP process around the STUDENT. 
Go beyond an IEP that checks the boxes and develop substantively compliant documents focused on each student. 
Gather the right data throughout the year to make this process much easier.
Engage with families as collaborative partners (by using the UDL elements) 
Craft IEPs that ensure entry point to the Gen Ed curriculum while meeting the students where they are instructionally through SDI and Progress Monitoring

In this workshop, we are going to break down some IEPs and together use these best practices. Once we approach IEP writing with the student at the center of the process and always focus on being substantively compliant, we will find it’s actually impossible to write a duplicate IEP for a student year after year. 

We will use the data from specific screeners and progress monitoring tools and curriculum resources we are already familiar with, but you should be able to transfer this to any resources you are already using in your school. 

To do this we will look at all aspects of the IEP. This includes 
Student information: This personal information will be very similar in IEPS, whether it is written to be procedurally compliant or taken the extra step to be substantively individualized to the specific student. We will not see much differentiation in this section 
Present Levels of Performance (PLAAFP):
The PLAAFP statement describes what the student “CAN DO” at the time the IEP is developed. It should clearly summarize the student’s present skill levels and identify specific skills, behaviors, or supports the student should receive instruction in in order to access the general education curriculum to the greatest possible extent. 

The current emphasis on IEP,s supporting the whole child while monitoring a student’s progress toward goals, it has become more important than ever to develop student-focused PLAAFP statements. 
Let’s take a look at a procedurally compliant PLAAFP statement - “show Remy’s P iep” - This statement meets the legal requirements - but its focus on teacher’s activities makes it general enough to be repurposed and used with additional students. 

Consider the last statement in our description of the why of a PLAAFP statement, “receive instruction in order to access/participate/be educated with the general education curriculum to the greatest extent possible”. A true PLAAFP is developed for an individual student and the student’s needs should be at the center of this statement.           

How does Remy’s PLAAFP truly reflect what he can do and where he struggles in this second PLAAFP statement?

A well-written PLAAFP demonstrates that the IEP team understands the impact of the learner’s disability, helps the team determine what services and accommodations your child needs in order to be educated in the general education curriculum to the maximum extent appropriate. (The general education curriculum means the courses the school uses to teach children within the school district.) Children learn information and skills necessary to meet state academic standards and graduation requirements by participating in the general education curriculum, regardless of classroom placement.
Evaluation results: This information can be included in the PLAAFP or it can be listed separately - depending on how different states structure IEP documents. At a minimum, this information should be pulled from multiple sources, correlate with the PLAAFP, and include district and/or state-wide assessment results.  

What differences do you notice between the two IEPs? ( S has more than one school year, and includes more assessments with consistent results)
Measurable goals: An IEP goal should be specific to the student it is written for - and be specific enough that progress toward it can be monitored by anyone on the IEP team, family members, and educators who may support the student. It should also meet the guidelines of SMART. Take a look at the two goals - how is the second one different than the first “p” - beyond the inclusion of discrete short term objectives that build from Remy’s PLAAFP.
Special education and related services: It’s important to keep in mind that every student is a general education student first and is entitled to a free and appropriate education in the least restrictive environment possible. The purpose of this section is to describe the support necessary for a student to achieve their measurable goal(s) and access the general education curriculum to the greatest extent possible. Because this section focuses on how paras, interventionists, case managers and tutors will support a student - it can become a statement tht focuses on what those individuals are doing - rather than on the expected growth of the student because of those actions. 

This statement should describe the student’s actions and environment - what the student is doing, working toward, and how they are being supported. 
Accommodations and modifications: This section describes specific adjustments to the learning environment or instructional methods to ensure the student can participate in class and demonstrate their knowledge, without fundamentally altering the curriculum. In most states these accommodations are documented year round so that the student can utilize them during the high stakes/state tests. Consider that the student is being assessed using the same test as his general education peers only with these modifications to his environment. The environment is modified not the curriculum.
Least Restrictive Environment (LRE): Just like with accommodations and modifications - the learning environment the student will participate in takes center stage. Look at the two sample IEPs - One describes how the student will engage to the fullest extent possible - with the general education curriculum and his peers. The other describes the impact the student will have on the learning environment and his peers. It is useful to remember the purpose of this plan - is to support the student it is written for.
Frequency, duration, and location of services: This is factual information from a schedule and remains consistent in both IEPs.
